# RECIPE BERRY
**Recipe Berry** is a full stack web application designed to help everyday chefs organize and manage their favorite recipes. This app aims to help simplify the search of culinary pursuits by providing a central destination to discover, create, favorite, and review recipes. Using The Meal DB API, data was gathered to generate a library of recipes for users to explore. Users can customize their favorite recipes and rate recipes within the community. Find inspiration for your next meal with Recipe Berry.

## <a name="why"></a>Why Recipe Berry?

Recipe Berry was developed as my solo capstone project at Hackbright Academy. Inspired by my love for food and exploring various cuisines in the kitchen, I designed Recipe Berry to share my passion with others. Often finding it difficult to find recipes in one place, I was motivated to develop a central destination to store, manage, and organize all my favorite recipes. Recipe Berry is the virtual cookbook organizer I wish I had and I hope you enjoy using it too.
